# LyricAlly
Welcome to LyricAlly! Have you ever sung a tune you only knew one line of, and couldn't get it out of your head, but also couldn't listen to it because you couldn't remember what song it belonged to? Well, LyricAlly is here to help!

Just type in your lyrics, or filter by track name if you know it. You also have the option to search only by lyrics, or search for the video that that song is associated with.

This is only the start of what will surely scratch that itch when Shazam thinks you're too off pitch to pinpoint that song.

Get your LyricAlly going!
