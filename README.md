##USER STORY
As a USER i want to:
search for a segment of lyrics or themes and be able to select those songs and watch the music videos.

I want to have a library of a group of songs containing: "specific lyrics" or "theme" (idk if theme is the correct word, like romantic or funny*) Genre?
So that the user can enjoy songs about their targeted lyrics or theme.
